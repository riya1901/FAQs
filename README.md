## 🚀 How Does It Work?  
1. **User requests an FAQ with a language parameter** (e.g., `?lang=bn` for Bengali).  
2. The system **checks Redis cache** to see if the translated FAQ exists.  
3. If cached, it **returns the stored translation instantly**.  
4. If not cached, it **fetches the original question**, translates it dynamically, and caches it for future use.  
5. The response is sent back **in the requested language only**, ensuring a clean user experience.  

### 📌 Example API Calls

    {
        "question": "आपका क्या नाम है?",
        "answer": "मेरा नाम रिया है।"
